NerdWallet typically recommends keeping auto loans to no more than 60 months for new cars and 36 months for used cars — although that can be a challenge for some people in today’s market with high car prices.

Ultimately, choosing the best auto loan term depends on balancing cost, affordability and your specific needs. Long-term auto loans might help you afford a car, but they can cost you more in the long run. Short-term loans will cost less overall, but wouldn’t be a wise choice if you can’t afford the monthly payments and fall behind.

What’s important is realizing that the auto loan term you agree to can make a big difference in what you pay monthly and in total. Instead of simply accepting the loan term offered by a lender or dealership, ask to see other terms or use an auto loan calculator to compare for yourself. Then choose the auto loan term that makes the most sense for you.
